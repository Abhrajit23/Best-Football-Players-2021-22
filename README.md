## Football Player Performance Analysis

### Overview
This repository contains code and data for analyzing football player performance using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling techniques. The analysis aims to provide insights into player performance trends and make predictions about future performance milestones.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is stored in the `players_1.csv` file. It includes information about football players, such as:

- Player name
- Position
- Age
- Market value
- Country
- Club
- Matches played
- Goals scored
- Assists
- Yellow cards
- Red cards
- Other relevant statistics

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA section explores various aspects of the dataset, including:

1. **Player Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of players across different positions and age groups.
2. **Country-wise Analysis**: Investigating the distribution of players based on their countries.
3. **Market Value Analysis**: Visualizing the market value of players and identifying the top 10 most expensive players.
4. **Player Comparison**: Comparing the performance of top players, such as Lionel Messi vs. Cristiano Ronaldo and Robert Lewandowski vs. Karim Benzema.
5. **PSG Analysis**: Conducting a detailed analysis of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) performance.

### Predictive Modeling
#### 1. Goals Prediction Model
- **Objective**: Predict the number of goals scored per match for the first 23 matches of the season.
- **Method**: Utilize linear regression to analyze historical data of matches played and goals scored by players.
- **Outcome**: Provide insights into goal-scoring trends and potential performance trajectories.

#### 2. Lewandowski Milestone Model
- **Objective**: Estimate the number of matches Robert Lewandowski will take to score 100 goals.
- **Method**: Apply linear regression to analyze Lewandowski's past performance and predict his future goal-scoring trajectory.
- **Outcome**: Provide a milestone projection for Lewandowski's goal-scoring achievement.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis and predictive modeling techniques can be applied to football player performance analysis. By leveraging data-driven insights, football clubs, coaches, and analysts can make informed decisions to optimize team strategies and player performance.
